This is a distributed simulation system. You can use this library for simulate networks, OS distributed Algorithm such as  Raymonds-Mutual-Exclusion-Algorithm.
(This is first release so it can has some bugs)

If You want use DSim library for initialize your disstributed system, you should do :
1- You can create nods that can  be have memory,cpu,processes and link to communication each other.
2- You must create Processor for your every node and give it an Algorithm such as Raymond mutual exclusion.
3- You must create Links for cennect nodes together and that impotant define start Node and End Node for every one.
4- You must set inComming links for each node and also comming out links.
5- You must create a memory for every nodes.
6- If you want sent message or add something to memory should be do it by node Proccesor.

Your Simple distributed System ready for use.
